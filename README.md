# Natural Language Inference
An experiment on Natural Language Inference (NLI) using traditional methods (A), Deep Learning (B) & Pretrained LLMs (C).

This experiment was conducted as part of coursework for the UoM course unit COMP34812: Natural Language Understanding. During this research three different methods were investigated: traditional methods, Deep Learning and Pretrained LLMs for the task of NLI. This research aimed at producing Machine Learning & NLU models best capable at determining whether sentences are semantically similar.

Early within this project it became clear that solutions B & C presented far better performance and improved room for advancement and therefore these solutions were pursued further. For [solution B](https://github.com/DennisKiselev/nlu-coursework/blob/main/submissions/training_B.ipynb), a Bi-LSTM with subtractive & multiplicative sentence fusion, attention, and pretrained language embeddings achieved a performance of 0.741 F1 score. For [solution C](https://github.com/DennisKiselev/nlu-coursework/blob/main/submissions/training_C.ipynb), ROBERTA was finetuned on augmented data, achieving a performance of 0.875 F1 score.

During this project a [poster](https://github.com/DennisKiselev/nlu-coursework/blob/main/submissions/poster.pdf) was produced to give a summary of the work conducted.
